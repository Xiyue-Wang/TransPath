## Transformer-based Unsupervised Contrastive Learning for Histopathological Image Classification (*Medical Image Analysis*)
The new better and stronger pre-trained transformers models [(**CTransPath**)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841522002043) has been released.

## Will updateï¼š CTransPath v2 coming soon (contains pre-training with over 100,000 WSIs) (Under Review).
It will be at least 5% better than **CtransPath**.

#### Hardware

* 128GB of RAM
* 32*Nvidia V100 32G GPUs

### Preparations
1.Download all [TCGA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects?filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22projects.program.name%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22TCGA%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D) WSIs.

2.Download all [PAIP](http://wisepaip.org/paip) WSI


New: So, there will be about 15,000,000 images.

Old: We crop these WSIs into patch images.we randomly select 100 images from each WSI.Finally,So, there will be about 2,700,521 unlabeled histopathological
images.

### Usage: Pre-Training Vision Transformers for histopathology images

It is recommended that you use **CTransPath** as the preferred histopathology images feature extractor

#### 1.CTransPath

##### Usage: Preparation
Install the modified [timm](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JV7aj9rKqGedXY1TdDfi3dP07022hcgZ/view?usp=sharing) library
```
pip install timm-0.5.4.tar
```

The pre-trained models can be [downloaded](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DoDx_70_TLj98gTf6YTXnu4tFhsFocDX/view?usp=sharing)

##### Usage: Get frozen features (tggates)

```
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 get_features_CTransPath.py --pretrained-weights /storage_mlr/lts/pathology/models/ctranspath/ctranspath.pth --dataset-dir DATASET_DIR --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR --batch-size 512
```
It is recommended to first try to extract features at 1.0mpp, and then try other magnifications

##### Usage: tggates few-shot classification
```
python tggates_fewshot_classification.py --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR --dataset-dir DATASET_DIR --train-set-path TRAIN_SET_PATH --test-set-path TEST_SET_PATH
```
`TRAIN_SET_PATH`/`TEST_SET_PATH` should point to the `.pth` files containing the filenames and labels per class. 
The patch files will then be loaded from the `DATASET_DIR`, their embeddings computed and then the few-shot classification will be performed.

##### Usage: Linear Classification
For linear classification on frozen features/weights

```
python ctrans_lincls.py
```
##### Usage: End-to-End Fine-tuning

Similar to Swin or ViT,please see the [instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer#swin-transformer) or [DEiT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit)

#### 2.MoCo v3 
We also trained [MoCo v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02057) on these histopathological images.
The pre-trained  models can be downloaded as following:

[vit_small](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13d_SHy9t9JCwp_MsU2oOUZ5AvI6tsC-K/view?usp=sharing)

Undated the latest weights have been uploaded (1/10/2022)
##### Usage: Self-supervised Pre-Training
please see the [instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/moco-v3)

##### Usage: Get frozen features

```
python get_features_mocov3.py \
        -a vit_small
```
##### Usage: End-to-End Fine-tuning ViT
To perform end-to-end fine-tuning for ViT, use our script to convert the pre-trained ViT checkpoint to [DEiT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit) format:
```
python convert_to_deit.py \
  --input [your checkpoint path]/[your checkpoint file].pth.tar \
  --output [target checkpoint file].pth
```
Then run the training (in the DeiT repo) with the converted checkpoint:
```
python $DEIT_DIR/main.py \
  --resume [target checkpoint file].pth \
  --epochs 150
```

#### 3.TransPath

The pre-trained  models can be [downloaded](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dhysqcv_Ct_A96qOF8i6COTK3jLb56vx/view?usp=sharing)

These codes are partly based on [byol](https://github.com/lucidrains/byol-pytorch) and [moco v2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/moco)
##### Usage: Self-supervised Pre-Training
```
python main_byol_transpath.py \
--lr 0.0001 \
--batch-size 256 \
--dist-url 'tcp://localhost:10001' --multiprocessing-distributed --world-size 1 --rank 0 --mlp --moco-t 0.2 --aug-plus --cos
```
##### Usage: Get frozen features
```
python get_feature_transpath.py
```

##### Usage: End-to-End Fine-tuning
use our script to convert the pre-trained ViT checkpoint to Transformers format:
```
python convert_to_transpath.py 
```
